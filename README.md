# A Prototype for surgical robotic, 2015 Spring Bio-Engineering Final Projcet

The source codes in this repo help you to manipulate a simple robotic arm with 4 DOFs and simple feedback system. The code "servoControlTest.ino" implements the control system using MG996 servo motors, while The code "FSR400.ino" is responsible for the feedback system using FSR400 and SG90 servo motor. 

More description will be added for your convenience ...
